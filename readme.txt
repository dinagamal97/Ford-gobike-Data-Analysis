Our data set consists of 174952 row in the bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area
with 16 features (duration_sec-start_time-end_time- start_station_id-start_station_name-
start_station_latitude-start_station_longitude-end_station_id-end_station_name -
end_station_latitude-end_station_longitude-bike_id-user_type-member_birth_year-member_gender- bike_share_for_all_trip )



## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, Members in different ages used to ride bikes which is a very healthy thing,
 there two type of user customer and subscriber the customer occubies 9% and consume more time than the
 subscriber members, we can see that the membes used to ride bikes in the weekend more than any days, the disappiont
 thing the male members is 3 times the femals which is a very starnge thing and on the other hand the most happiest
 thing is the members whose ages is more than 80 years also ride bikes

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on 5 features (duration time- member ages- member gender -user type-weekdays)
 I start with display the distribution of trip duration in sec, then the distribution of the other 4 features
 then I used the boxplot to show the relation between the members gender and duration time then, I used 
 the barplot to represent the relation between member ages and users type ,At the end I used the piontplot
 to show what age and gender spend more duration time
